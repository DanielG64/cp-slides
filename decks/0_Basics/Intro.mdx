## What is Competitive Programming?

<Content>

- Activity where participants compete to solve algorithmic problems
- Time frame of about 2 - 5 hours
- Competitive programming has many tangible benefits.
  - **Programming Interviews**: Many interviews for large companies require applicants to solve algorithmic problems to demonstrate capability.
  - **College Applications**: There's nothing that boosts your college applications like winning a big award. If you're dedicated enough, you can make it to the USA national competitive programming team's training camp.

<Notes>

- Curriuclum is Bronze to Silver only due to demographics of people who signed up.
- Our goal is to make this as _accessible_ and _fun_ to everyone as possible.
  - Instead of going faster with curriculum, we chose to participate in fun contests & add more Q&A time instead.
