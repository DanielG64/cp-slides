## Rectangle Geometry

<ListSteps>

- Problems involving rectangles whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
- Tip: Draw out the problem! This should logically lead to a solution.

</ListSteps>

## Example

[USACO 2017 Dec Bronze - Blocked Billboard](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=759)

Problem Statement:

Given two billboards and one truck (all rectangles), find the area of the billboards that arenâ€™t covered by the truck.

## Solution

<ListSteps>

- Coordinates are in the range [-1000, 1000]
- Simply go through 2000^2 possible visible squares and check which ones are visible using nested for loops.
- Note: You can also solve in O(1) with math!
